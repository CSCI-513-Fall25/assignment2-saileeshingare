In designing the game, I structured the code to separate responsibilities clearly. The OceanMap class handles the grid and ocean/island placement, keeping the map logic independent of the ships. The Ship class represents Columbusâ€™ ship and implements an observer pattern to notify PirateShip instances of movement, enabling pirates to chase him. Each PirateShip maintains its own position and updates its ImageView when notified, keeping the UI in sync. The OceanExplorer class orchestrates the game, including initializing ships, drawing the map, handling key events, and updating ship positions in real time. I also used JavaFX ImageViews for graphical representation and delayed game-over feedback to ensure a smooth visual experience.
